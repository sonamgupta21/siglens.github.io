              <h3>SigLens v/s Loki</h3>
              <p>
                Loki indexes only the metadata fields (labels) and not the actual log lines, enabling fast ingestion
                and smaller index sizes. However, this has an adverse effect on query times. If you are querying on
                the logline—most queries fall into this category—the query response times are in minutes.
                Additionally, it uses S3 for storing the loglines, incurring a lot of round trips to the S3 bucket.
                This further increases query response times and results in a higher AWS bill due to the repeated
                head/get requests to S3.
                <br> <br>
                SigLens indexes all fields including the logline using an innovative approach of microindexing. The
                micro indices are 1/100th the size of an actual index and therefore the index sizes are small and
                ingestion speed is fast. It does not suffer the disadvantage that loki has. Micro indices achieve
                almost the similar query performance that an actual index has although at 1/100th the cost. SigLens
                also invented AgileAggsTree which helps run aggregation queries at lightening fast speed. Aggregations
                queries with Loki are super slow.

              <h3>SigLens v/s Elasticsearch</h3>
              <p>
                Elasticsearch uses an inverted index that helps it in doing fast searches. The inverted index works well
                when there is more structured repeatable data. However, with the log lines, the data is almost always
                very unstructured. Due to this the index size grows. It is not uncommon to see the actual disk usage of
                ES to be 110% or more of the incoming volume due to its index. And as the index size grows , it does not
                fit on one machine requiring a cluster of machines. Elasticsearch also suffers from slow query times if
                you search on the log lines sub-texts. Aggregation queries also super slow with ES. Due to a need of
                multiple machines, it is quite common for elastic indices to be yellow/red routinely due to
                infra/security updates. This causes slower query and slower ingestion times.

                <br> <br>
                SigLens invented microindexing technology. The micro indices are 1/100th the size of an actual index and
                therefore the index sizes are small and ingestion speeds fast. SigLens uses dynamic columnar
                compressions, therefore the on disk storage size is often 10% of the incoming volume. This helps during
                query times and lower storage/compute requirements. The search/filter kind of queries perform 4x-8x
                faster than Elastic due to the microindexing tech. SigLens also invented the AigileAgssTree which helps
                run aggregation queries at lightening fast speed. Overall SigLens uses several magnitudes lower compute
                and storage compared to ES and has several magnitudes faster ingest and query times.

              <h3>SigLens v/s InfluxDB/parquet/Arrow</h3>
              <p> There are many products coming up in recent years like the InfluxDB IOx. This architecture involves
                converting incoming data into parquet files, storing them in S3, mapping the files in memory using
                Apache Arrow, and using the memory-mapped files to serve queries. This architecture has advantages of
                better compression ratios, faster ingestion, lower storage requirements. But it suffers on query
                response times. If your query touches on parquet files that are non memory mapped, then Apache Arrow
                drops the in-memory files, downloads/pulls the required parquet files and then serves the query. This
                has significant impact on query response times. If you have a set of queries that constantly query old
                and new data, then there is repeated loop of drop/pull causing queries to further slow down. Not to
                mention the repeated round trips to S3 thereby increasing your AWS bill. You are then forced to allocate
                a set of nodes to handle the queries, thereby increasing your infra cost and higher S3 transport costs.
                <br> <br>
                SigLens does not suffer from these issues. Due to its innovative approach it achieves a balance of
                faster ingestion, faster queries and lower hardware requirements The micro indices that SigLens invented
                are 1/100th the size of an actual index and therefore the index sizes are small and ingestion speeds
                fast. SigLens uses dynamic columnar compressions, therefore the on disk storage size is often 10% of the
                incoming volume. This helps during query times and lower storage/compute requirements. The search/filter
                kind of queries perform several magintudes faster than Influx due to the microindexing tech. SigLens
                also invented the AigileAgssTree which helps run aggregation queries at lightening fast speed. Overall
                SigLens uses several magnitudes lower compute compared to Influx/Parquet/Arrow and has several
                magnitudes faster ingest and query times.

              <h3>SigLens v/s ClickHouse</h3>
              <p>
                SigLens and ClickHouse have quite a few things in common. Both are columnar databases. Both achieve
                great compression ratios. The places where SigLens differs are dynamic columnar compression
                algorithms, Microindexing tech and AgileAggsTree. In ClickHouse you have to predefine the Engines on
                columns (MergeTree, etc..) and the Materialized views. For log related workload, the data changes
                quite often so it is an operational overhead that you have to bear with. SigLens on the other hand
                uses dynamic columnar compression and dynamic micro indices, wherein you don't need to predefine
                anything. SigLens reduces your operational overhead while still achieving similar or superior query
                performances.
                <br> <br>
                Due to its dynamic columnar compression algorithms it also achieves better compression ratios than
                ClickHouse. ClickHouse achieves faster ingestion speeds provided you send row updates in bulk. For
                analytical workloads its fine however for logging related workloads the log data is constantly coming
                in. If you wait for rows to accumulate in order to do bulk updates, then your queries can't search for
                the latest data. For observability and live debugging uses cases this is a problem. SigLens does not
                suffer from this issue.
                <br><br>
                ClickHouse does not support read-time field extraction, a very popular feature that developers use
                during production issues. Splunk is the only product that supports this. But now SigLens is the only
                other product that has this feature. During ingestion you can ingest whatever format and whatever you
                want and during query SigLens/Splunk will let you create dynamic fields based on the log line and use
                it in further pipelining of the queries. SigLens/Splunk support the pipe-based query language, a very
                popular feature amongst developers, ClickHouse does not support this.
